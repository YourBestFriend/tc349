   HappyCog.com is immediately simple and user-friendly. The page 
isn't cluttered with content and colors are pure and without 
gradient.  They use a clean, friendly font and spaciously display 
their sections below large, descriptive header text. The content 
is spread down the page quite a distance, which could have caused 
issues if these sections were frequented by users, however, links 
on the top of the page take you right to the action. This approach 
is actually rather nice, as it allows for easy content browsing.

   The collection of fonts and graphics work well together and 
colors are varied but unified. Having a link bar follow you down 
the page only to nest itself below the header when you surface is a 
useful and aesthetically pleasing feature, especially for this 
navigation style. Ultimately, this website is well thought out and 
easily admired.
