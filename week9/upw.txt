   While other websites (especially those for largely unknown companies) 
tend to introduce themselves first or show you some brand-building 
photography, UnitedPixelWorkers.com goes straight for the throat. The 
homepage is crammed from top to bottom with merchandise, which is a 
truly terrible idea. This style of presentation makes the products look 
unaffectionately numerous and despite their efforts to make the shirts 
appear lazily tossed into the camera-frame, the whole experience comes 
off as a little sterile. I don't think there is one person on the entire 
website, no models, no hint that these patches of cloth are even for 
real human beings.

   The main problem is that the boxes in their gallery-style layout are 
too small and all crammed onto one page. They have some strange idea 
that if they show you everything all at once, your more likely to find 
something you like. This thinking is flat-out flawed. Put too many trees 
in one place and all people see is a forest. 

   This company is clearly focused on doing one thing and doing it 
simply, screen-printing. Wouldn't it be great if their website could 
capture this simplicity. They have no interest in different fits or 
gender differentiation which is great and, if marketed properly, rather 
charming. However, this website does their single-minded obsession no 
favors. It throws merchandise in your face before shaking your hand, and 
I don't like it.
