   Heroku.com offers users an aesthetically pleasing design that works well 
to simplify the large amount of content contained on the site. Sadly, the 
home page is probably my least favorite on the site. It is comprised 
entirely of different shades of the same color and sports little more than 
a bland heading and some uninteresting graphics. 

   Thankfully, upon navigating past the homepage, you'll find beautifully 
designed charts and tables such as those on the “How it Works” and “Pricing” 
tabs. Additional colors are also introduced in side pages and make up a 
rather appealing color-scheme. I especially enjoy the subtle color shift on 
the “Add-ons” tab. This serves to keep things interesting and make each page 
feel unique. In fact, I think it would be an improvement to do subtle color 
shifts like this across all the primary content pages. This could even be 
used to sort different sections of the website.

   The primary concern for a website, however, is the user-friendliness. 
This is where heroku.com shines. All points of interaction are clearly 
labeled and adequately distinguished from the background upon mousing over. 
The site feels interactive and easily navigable. I also love their logo!





MY LAYOUT

I choose to use the double layout as I felt it best fit my current content.
I don't have alot of images or small articles to sort into a "gallery" style,
and didn't find the "single" style to be much different from the website
layout that I originally had. (The single style also wasn't very interesting
to implement.) Maybe tommorrow night I'll play around with my site a little
more for next week. I would like to add in a background from subtlepatterns.
