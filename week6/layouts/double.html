            <p>Well, I met you at the blood bank We were looking at the bags Wondering 
                if any of the colors Matched any of the names we knew on the tags You 
                said, see look that's yours Stacked on top with your brother's See how 
                they resemble one another Even in their plastic little covers And I 
                said I know it well That secret that you knew but don't know how to tell
                It fucks with your honor and it teases your head But you know that it's 
                good girl 'Cause its running you with red</P>
            <p>Then the snow started falling We were stuck out in your car You were 
                rubbing both of my hands Chewing on a candy bar You said, ain't this just 
                like the present To be showing up like this? As a moon waned to crescent 
                We started to kiss And I said I know it well That secret that we know that 
                we don't know how to tell I'm in love with your honor, I'm in love with 
                your cheeks What's that noise up the stairs, babe? Is that Christmas morning 
                creaks?</p>
