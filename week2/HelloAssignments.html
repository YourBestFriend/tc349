  <h2>Professional Bio</h2>
  <p>Tim Hasselbeck is a sophomore at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan<br />
    where he majors in Computer Science. He enjoys the many challenges and possibilities<br />
    presented by his area of study and hopes to one day combine his passions for programming<br />
    and digital entertainment. In his spare time Tim plays guitar, piano, and video games with<br /> 
    his three brothers.<br />

  <h2>Panic.com Critique</h2>
  <p>Panic.com certainly offers users a squeaky clean interface... maybe too clean?<br /> 
    I suppose not. If the home page was anything other than a fork in the road for its<br /> 
    users the layout could become unintuitive. However, as it is used as a bulletin-board<br /> 
    showing shiny images of places you should want to visit, it probably serves its purpose.<br /> 
    Luckily, the links pop up description boxes when you mouse over them, otherwise the<br /> 
    web-page would seem like little more than an advertisement in a magazine.<br />
      <br />
	I do like the gently shaded background, and the style of the icons and color scheme do<br /> 
    match the youthy innocence of the companies self-description. But there's just something<br /> 
    entirely too chipper about the whole thing... like the thin, bleached smiles on late-night<br /> 
    infomercials. Nobody's that nice...<br />
