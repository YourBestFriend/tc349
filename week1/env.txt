	I think I've settled on a development environment I'm fairly
happy with. For my text editor I'm using emacs. This is primarily 
because it is recommended that I use emacs or vim for my programming 
classes and after talking to some people I settled on emacs if only 
because of their slight preference. I don't really know enough about 
the two programs to offer any in depth reasoning as to why I settled
on emacs. 

	As for my browser, I'm currently using Firefox for two reasons.
Firstly, it's what I've always used and habit is a powerful thing and 
secondly, because I like the look of its logo on my desktop(I've just
never been a fan of the chrome logo). I may try out chrome in the
near future however.

	Finally, I'm using Git/GitHub... but the reason for that is
obvious! Also, as you will notice from my screenshot, I'm working
in linux. I do this because my programming classes are taught using
linux.
