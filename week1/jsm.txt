	Overall, I really like the setup of the Jason Santa Maria website. It's 
interesting and alive without being cluttered. The window blinds-esk way in 
which they sort articles is very efficient and pleasing to the eye. The bottom 
natigation/etc panel is also very cool and offset from the primary site content 
above via its extreme contrast. The flow seems very good to me as users breeze
past the recent content as they navigate towards the search bar. This ensures
even the single-minded explorer is teased with new content on their way to a
point of interest.
	I do have one slight issue with the page, however. I personally do not
generally like plain white backgrounds on websites. I can't quite put my finger
on why, but I think it has something to do with the way it prevents the images
from popping out at you. I do mind it less in this case than usual, however, so
maybe that says something. I also dislike the blogger minima template for this 
same reason, am I truely the only one?
