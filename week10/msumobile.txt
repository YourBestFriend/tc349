   Admittedly, I don't have much experience browsing the web on 
mobile devices. However, the focus of the MSU mobile site seems 
to be ease of use and simplicity. In this respect I think the 
site is probably reasonably well designed. There isn't a lot of 
clutter and icons are large enough to be easily interacted with. 
Aesthetically, however, the site leaves something to be desired. 
It's not particularly pretty, with icons appearing as solid 
green silhouettes on a background of untextured gray.

   This site is all utility, and with that in mind most 
everything mobile-users might be looking for seems to be within 
easy reach. Maps, news, school events calendars, all very handy 
and straight to the point. I just wish it presented itself a 
little better. I understand the strict focus on school colors, 
but even within this constraint I think the site could be 
significantly improved with a textured background and new icons 
that have a little more character.
