   Fueled.com, aside from having an incredible standard 
site, offers one of the best mobile experiences I've seen. 
The original website is significantly modified for mobile 
users, giving the impression that it was never meant to be 
viewed any other way. Every link and logo is clearly 
displayed and arranged in a way that makes sense for the 
platform. The overall design is simplified but equally 
appealing. 

   The website is easy to read and a breeze to navigate 
through. If I had one complaint it would probably be the 
primarily monochromatic nature of the color scheme. It's a 
lot of gray, black, and white with little else. However, 
this is only a minor issue and probably boils down to more 
of a personal preference of mine. Ultimately, this is a 
mobile site done right.
