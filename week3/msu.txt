	The MSU website is a billboard, suitably stained green and designed 
to overwhelm its users with glossy articles, all alluding to the greatness 
of the institution. Its home page a cursory recruitment tool, of little 
practical use or interest to current students. Concern primarily lies with 
ensuring users get suitably impressed before moving on to scrutinize some 
other prospective school. Compared to more user-focused websites the layout 
feels a tad noisy and cluttered, but I suppose it's all well oiled and tidy 
as prestige factories go. 

	Maybe that isn't entirely fair. It does, after all, contain a link 
bar on top which seems genuinely interested in helping people. Ultimately, 
I think the homepage serves its purpose well enough and the website works 
decently well. I'm not a fan of the layout as I think its busyness hurts 
the overall flow and I don't find it very interesting, however, I'm also 
having a pretty lousy day so who knows.
