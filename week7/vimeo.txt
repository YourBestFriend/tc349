   Vimeo has chosen to go with an inviting cartoon-style aesthetic 
which does serve to visually set it apart from its competition. I 
appreciate that vimeo actually picked a style instead of making a 
more simplistic layout that wouldn't alienate any possible audience, 
like youtube or facebook. Not everyone will enjoy this style but 
it's nice to see a website actually reach in some defined direction. 

   Layout-wise everything seems suitably clean and user-friendly. 
The page does stretch down quite a ways but the most important 
things are situated mostly within one screen height for clear 
presentation to users (though the top header section is a little 
over-large, possibly just to display their graphic art. If this is 
the case, I think a better setup needs to be explored). Still, I 
can't help but wonder if it wouldn't be an improvement just to move 
the lower content sections onto new pages and link to them via tabs 
along the top or sides of the homepage. They really have very little 
to do with the primary content on the page anyways.
