  <h1>Final Project Website</h1>
    <p>For my final project website I would like to make a website for my mom's business.<br />
        She does patent drawings and has been wanting an official website for some time.<br />
        I'm a little worried about doing card sorting for this website, however, since<br />
        there won't be a huge amount of content. Nevertheless, I will give it a solid<br />
        effort!<br />
    </p>
    <h2>Card Sorting</h2>
    <h3>Similarity Matrix</h3>

    <p>This similarity matrix displays participant agreement pertaining to card grouping.</p>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>I actually personally did two of of the five card sorting surveys this time. This <br />
        is due to the fact that I had two significantly different ideas of how to organize <br />
        the website. Hopefully this isn't bad practice (I suppose it probably is). Also, <br />
        this study only contains six cards as the website I want to make for my final project <br />
        will not have any huge amount of content on it.<br />
        <br />
        The major difference between the different participants was what was placed on the <br />
        main page of the website. There was a fairly even divide between those who wanted<br />
        to put "Description of Service" on the home page and those who wanted to put "About <br />
        The Company" as the face of the website.<br />
