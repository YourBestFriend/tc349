                <h2 class="r-title">Advantages of Professional Patent Drawings</h2>
                </hgroup>
                <p class="p1">Patent drawings are one of the key components of a patent application. 
                    Professional drawings help completely cover the invention and all permutations. 
                    Detailed patent drawings can save you if a key component or feature was 
                    accidentally left out of the written disclosure. The USPTO frequently views 
                    drawings in order to determine what was disclosed at the time the application 
                    was filed.
                    <br/>
                    <br />
                    There are several key components to creating patent drawings that the inventor, 
                    patent attorney, and ultimately the USPTO find readable, understandable, and 
                    aesthetically pleasing.
                    <br/>
                    <br />
                    A patent drawing must accurate. It should reflect the form, surface finish, 
                    and material of the subject matter. A patent drawing must be clear. Certain 
                    elements of the subject may be omitted, phantomed, or sectioned for increased 
                    clarity. The composition must be pleasing. How the subject fills the space and 
                    the choice of viewing angle contribute to the overall effect. The drawing 
                    technique should be appropriate. Line weights, tone, and shading should relate 
                    to the scale, mass, and surface of the subject.
                    <br />

                </p>
                    <h3>Number of Views</h3>
                <p class="p1">
                    There should be as many views drawn as needed to clearly disclose the invention 
                    and its novelty, i.e., front, rear, right and left sides, top and bottom. While 
                    not required, it is suggested that perspective views be submitted to clearly 
                    show the shape and appearance of thee-dimensional designs. For design patent 
                    drawings, if a perspective view is submitted, the surfaces shown would normally 
                    not be required to be illustrated in other views if these surfaces are clearly 
                    understood and disclosed in the perspective.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                </p>
                    <h3>Drawing Preparation</h3>
                <p class="p1">
                    The drawings should be done in black and white, unless color is needed to 
                    illustrate specifics of the invention or idea. The scale should be large enough 
                    to show the mechanism without crowding when the drawing is reduced to size in 
                    two-thirds in reproductions. Patent drawings should be done on high quality 
                    paper that is strong and non-glossy. All sheets must be free from cracks, 
                    creases and folds. Only one side of the sheet may be used for the drawing. Each 
                    sheet must be free from erasures and free from alterations, overwritings, and 
                    interlineations.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This is why it is best to hire a professional draftsman to do this work as it 
                    can be difficult to do for those who are not experienced with scaled drawings, 
                    multiple views and patent office standards.
