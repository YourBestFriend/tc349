    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This card sorting survey was conducted using 4 participants including myself.<br />
        It turned out that every participant ended up using three groups and this is<br />
        probably due to two reasons. First, I mentioned that I used three groups while<br />
        explaining the survey. And Second, there wasn't very much content on the site<br />
        and, therefore, there weren't very many cards to support a larger number of <br />
        groups. <br />
        <br />
        I did not include the blog as a card, but rather the contents of the<br />
        blog as various cards. This was to see if anyone would create a "Blog" category<br />
        of their own for the content. One person did do this, though they included<br />
        other material and called it a "Stream".<br />
        <br />
        There were certainly similarities between the sorts, mostly in the function of <br />
        each of the three groups. All but one of the participants had a main page, an<br />
        ordering section, and a "More Infomation" or "About Our Company" section. The<br />
        fourth participant opted for a "Stream" which held much of the same information.<br />
        <br />
        The differences that occured seemed to me to be largely due to the participants<br />
        misunderstanding my labels to some extent. For example, they thought "Product<br />
        Reviews" were peer to peer, rather than from magazines. I believe this caused<br />
        a larger percentage of participants to place the reviews on the purchasing page,<br />
        much like Amazon or Ebay.<br />
        <br />
        My sort in particular was fairly similiar to the Foldable.Me website, probably<br />
        because it's harder to see something through clear eyes after you've experienced<br />
        it one way. Like watching a movie then reading the book. There were a few<br />
        differences, however, and they included the following. I moved the website <br />
        launch article from the Blog section to the main page and transfered most of the<br />
        other blog posts into an "About Us" section. <br />
        <br />
        I honestly wasn't exactly sure what was expected for this assignment, so<br />
        hopefully this is similar to what was intended by the project. I rethought<br />
        things a little after the survey was conducted oh ways I could have perhaps<br />
        made the cards a little clearer. However, at the risk of re-annoying my<br />
        friends I decided against another round of sorting.<br />
