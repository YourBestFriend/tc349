   I very much enjoy what Chartbeat.com has done with itself. 
It's playful and interesting while still being sensible. I 
love how the website moves as you scroll, especially in the 
“Act when it matters” section. The dissipating clutter is a 
great effect. Also, the various meters keeping track of the 
number of pixels you've scrolled over or the number of 
seconds you've been around add a great interactivity to the 
experience. The 30-day trial offer on the bottom of the page 
is yet another well done feature.

   This site is busy in the best of ways and I haven't seen 
anything else quite like it, which is a rare thing to 
discover. “Real-time data for front-line doers,” this website 
if just full of character. I get the feeling that whoever 
designed it was having quite a bit of fun. I'd like to see 
more websites like this around the net.
