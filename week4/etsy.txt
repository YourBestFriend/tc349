	Etsy.com has a very simple design. This is perhaps because the creator 
didn't want to choose a theme with any particular style. Keeping the layout 
generic could serve to minimize visual clashes with various pieces of artwork 
sold on the site. Such a simple design also helps to avoid the alienation of 
users of varying age or stylistic preference. I assume this would play a role 
in many different websites which are designed to appeal to a mass audience. 
For example, a website like Facebook which is also rather stylistically neutral.
	
	As I've mentioned in the past I do prefer darker colored backgrounds on 
websites. Especially so,  when the website is focused on displaying pictures or 
artwork. I much favor a design more similar to that of DeviantArt.com. I feel 
that visually muted backgrounds enhance the overall aesthetic of artwork or 
products on display.
